- Interactive visualizations

# üìä Key Findings
1. [Most common crime types]  
2. [Peak times for criminal activity]  
3. [High-risk locations]  
4. [Significant demographic correlations]  
5. [Seasonal patterns]

### üîç Key Features

1. *Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Pipeline*  
   - Ensures the dataset is free of errors, inconsistencies, and missing values.  
   - Prepares the data for accurate analysis and modeling.

2. *Temporal Analysis (Hourly/Daily/Monthly Trends)*  
   - Identifies patterns in crime over time, such as peak hours or seasonal trends.  
   - Helps law enforcement allocate resources effectively.

3. *Geographical Hotspot Mapping*  
   - Visualizes areas with high crime concentrations using heatmaps.  
   - Assists in prioritizing intervention efforts.

4. *Demographic Correlations*  
   - Explores relationships between crime and demographic factors like age or income.  
   - Provides insights for targeted policy interventions.

6. *Interactive Visualizations*  
   - Creates dynamic charts and maps for easy exploration of data.  
   - Makes insights accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
